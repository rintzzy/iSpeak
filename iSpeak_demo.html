   <p>You see Payal, violence born from injustice no matter how much its valid. There're lot of people still believe 
    that it's just an accident that very likely to happen by boys or it's the dress of that girl that drove her to rape.
    You can't hang them each one by one.

   <p>No. Punishment can't give us anything to dig into deep to eradicate it. What is most important is we need to understand
    the moment the man was thinking to rape and the moment right after it. Technically we need to get into the brain of the convict and research him.

   <p>U should think I'm mad, ri8? No. You see, we every time say that it's the point of view that needs to be changed. But that convict was a normal
   man like us before where we were his surroundings. That man shouldn't have some spcl glass where he can get that 'cool' point of view. It's us that affects
   his normal view.

   <p>There's another thing. Our parents are obsessed about leading us a successful career. But if you notice, they don't give their children/boy
   a good education about a girl/woman. They just bypass it. Then it comes down to erotic stuffs on TV,magazines and yes, our very own friends.
   Our friends are already being corrupted by mind which in turns corrupts us.

   <p>Nice point. In item songs, the girl's desire towards the men is 'come have some' which is erotic enough. Now, the man won't go to do rape now.
   It'll last for some time. But what it does is, it helps to strengthen his corrupted view about women. Here's the liability of movie directors.
   And talking abt 'other stuffs', if u restrict your bro not to watch porn, he'll eventually find out a way to watch it. See, it's not clear to him
   why it's not worth to watch.

   <p>Exactly. Our parents, brothers, sisters, teachers noone are open minded enough to talk about it. But its very important to properly introduce to
   the boy what a girl/woman is; how and why should u treat her in way that u treat a man and physical differences, sexual urge. Bringing sexual education
   to school grade won't do the change, brother. Becoz these are our building blocks. If they talk about these with us, we won't have any wrong concept about
   women.
