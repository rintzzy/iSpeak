   <p>We all know that we're successively failing to even lower the rate at which rape is happening in various states in India, amongst which U.P and West Bengal
are infamous. But I don't want to bother about statistics. I wanna bother about the reasons of failure & possible solutions at hand. I wouldn't mind if
you don't buy it, in that case I want you to give your own solution on this.

   <h2>The Problems ::</h2>
   <p>If someone offend someone, sure that's wrong and must be punishable. Fair. But do you ever wonder, there were so many rapings happened so far, and there were
 so many prosecution done. Then why someone just not stopping not to rape someone?</p>
   <p>The reason is the way the main 2 characters plays the role in us. They are - 1) Law and 2) Society</p>
   <p> You see, rape is not a crime like murder where the main motive for the murderer is to finish off the person. Rather, in rape the main motive for the 
  rapist(s) is to take advantage of someone with power. In a world like this who doesn't want to take advantage with power?</p>
   <p>And perhaps the most precise reason is our society is responsible for this. Hence, you can't prevent this thing with just punishment. Which means it's 
  time to think of some other solutions apart from physical punishment.</p>
 </article>
 <article>
   <p>Let's talk about all the reasons.</p>
 </article>
 <article>
   <p><b>1) Law :</b> If something is full of flaws, then it's this country's law and law-protectors. There's only 2 modes of punishments - either money or 
           imprisonment. The amount of money as fine is not some big like 1 million so that the convict can't arrange that much money. Its just some thousands.
		   In stead it's seen often that the money is arranged and convict got bail and then rapes again. And by the way, anything is possible literally with 
		   the help of some big cheap politicians. They are always eager to help to cover up things if you're their supporter. What it's real and long term effects is,
           people know exactly where and how to bend the law and evade away. And remember, rapist(s) is/are the normal people like us. So, when you know that you've
		   option to get away, do you need to worry about anything?

   <p><b>2) Society :</b> One can ask that why the whole society be responsible for the man who raped. Let me tell you then, that man was not "rapist" by social-
               identification until today, but he has been a "rapist" for years by his nature. Who counts that? And remember, a tree can't grow fruits
               without optimum condition. Same as here. That man was a child at some age. This is the time of a child's life that give shapes to his entire life. Unfortunately
               we Indian people always think this "giving good shapes to our child" as good education only and good education means only book oriented education.
               Parents and friends are two elementary people, as and from childhood we have. Our parents try to cultivate only our good portion and strictly 
               prohibit not to do a "bad thing". But they don't illustrate as to why it's so bad and why their child shouldn't do it. On the other hand.
               Our friends cultivate our bad portion. It does entertain but it affects seriously on us. Thus we screw each other's nature and mind. We first
               learn from our friends many things about women - how to hit on them, make fun of them, tease them and thereafter irritate them and their body parts. 
			   Thus already we've learnt women are just toys to played with your own power since they're weak. This "education" further strengthens with the help
               of "spicy"(both action and erotic) films. But parents is that vital element for every child which cumulatively is source of logical knowledge,
			   guidance and which is alone capable of driving their infants to a right direction. Here in reality what do we see? Our parents are not frank with us
			   at all - they always keep a tough and scary looks in their "ruling" behaviour. And they're obsessed about our school,college,marks,ranks,jobs,marriage etc. except
			   the thing which is most important. Parents bypass the education of "introduction to opposite gender" completely. We deal with this ourselves with the
               help of our friends.

   <p><b>3) Dress & Porn :</b></p> No, these are not the sole reasons. What to eat/wear/see/speak is equally that much freedom for a woman as compared to a man. Some old-class-fungy-puky
              peoples still think its her dress that lead her to be raped. You peoples really deserves Noble Peace Prize. Why you guys are doing here?
              Anyway, think this way. Suppose a woman wears a bikini, but she looks as bad as sewage. Would you want to rape that woman? Answer would be no.
              So, this means here a choice matters which triggers him to further proceed. This clearly opt out Dress issue. If you still not convinced, then what about the 
			  children of 2-5 years of age who gets raped? What do they wear? Bikinis?
			       Now to Porn. The truth is sometime we both male and female need porns. You can't deny the fact that everybody has a sexual desire buried inside. As our body developes,
              our sexual-desire also grows. Porn meets the demands of our own sexual-needs and we feel enjoyable. Keynote is the reaction of thus erotic stimulation lasts for
              just sometime. It doesn't have that power to drive someone to think, "Let's go have some rape's done". But it does impact on us more than anything. As we can see 
              women on pornography as naked and having sex, the first reaction is "wow". Why is that? Because, it's something we never get to see in real, just heard about it.
              Soon we got aroused and a concept is grown which is - "women are for sex." This is where it gets important. Until we're mentally matured, we think that sex is a 
              "thing for fun & pleasure".

    <p><b>4) Controversial facts :</b> If I'm a man, then I can even walk topless. And I don't have any "amazing awkward curious thing" on my body part. But what's in that thing and why is
                           shame to display it? We men don't have any shame to show our chest. Its just a body part. Then why is so unfair? -- When a child's eye meet with a girl,
                           this is the question that raised at a point inside him. Noone feed logical answer to the child's curiosity. And as you might know, the more you be curious, the more
						   the more you would want to know the truth. I think you understood what I meant by "the truth".

 <h2>The Solutions ::</h2>
 <article>
    <p>The solutions are very technical, rather than straightforward do-these-do-that. I'm discussing that below -</p>
	<p><b>1) Counsel instead of punishment :</b> Physical punishment is a very short-term way to shut things off. Its not a solution. In a crime like rape, we must think of something that is long-term basis
                                     and which is a solution. The death of the convict doesn't guarantee that another rape won't happen. Either way the rapings are still on. Then what's
                                     the point of make him die? Does his death undo the situation before rape to that woman? No. Now you all should ask me, so the rapist(s) will not be 
                                     punished? Hell no. That's why I used "physical punishment"	phrase. There's way to punish someone mentally by confession and then making him go through the whole situation
                                     and then rectify him. The whole process can be done with counselling. And why do we need to do exactly this? Because, we don't know any information based on
                                     the situation before and after he raped : what he was thinking about her, did he feel no fear, what he generally thinks about all women. These information will
                                     help to build a model of a social catalogue where we can then further understand where we need to do further development.

    <p><b>2) Parents needs moral education :</b> Its the parent who needs to understand that their job is not limited to only on their childs' education, school, marks etc., but to also on the moral
                                     education which is no. 1 priority. In order to do this, parents themselves need to understand that there's no better relationship than friendship. If you can be 
                                     best friend with your child, then what's the need to be "tough ruler"? Friendly means frankly which means two peoples can talk about anything. This is pretty much needed.
                                     For reality example, if you be the son of your parents, then your parents know much more than you about condom. Not only they know much, but also their knowledge bears
                                     accuracy and experience compared to yourself and your friends. Forget sex, even in matters of love, we tremendously fear about telling it to our parents. So, this is the
                                     situation as if I committed a 26/11. So, when there's no transparency between we and our parents, its more likely that we make transparency with our dear friends instead. This is the
                                     thing we should prevent. But how? We parents need to be more open with our children. Because parents are the only one who can logically answer all the curiosity that their 
                                     children raises and also can tell the reasons why it's bad that their child did and why he shouldn't do it rather than just simply ordering their child not to do a "bad" thing.
                                     And most importantly, parents need to introduce the concept of "introduction to opposite gender" to their boy. You see, it's very very important how do we see a woman. But how can we do
									 so? It's not that simple as buying a lens from lenskart.com and see a woman. That's why it needs guidance. Parents need to teach their boy that there's no such difference between a 
									 male and female apart from some physical attributes. Parents should give their children as logical, transparent and unbiased knowledge as much they can to their children on this matter.
									 And if you think a step ahead, you can understand that at a later stage, those children will have a solid logical knowledge from why a girl is just as same like us, why we should treat same
									 like us, what is menstruration, why it's not bad, what is sex etc. Thus curiosity comes to an end. When curiosity comes to an end with solid logical knowledge, people do only rightful things.

    <p><b>3) Centralised Police :</b> People do understands that police are always under the feet of ruling party in the state. That's why a accused/convict can go free. Whoever has the right to do it, has to make Police
                          a centralised members. Thus, ruling party or any politicians won't have any right to blend them in. You see, people are getting the fact that if you're closed to the ruling party, you can get 
                          away with any crime, a rape even. It just strengthens already convicted/accused persons to do further crime.
